# WiseChoice
Your Intelligent Shopping Companion


WiseChoice is primarily designed to eliminate the "Analysis Paralysis" problem that an e-commerce shopper often faces during decision-making about a product. It is believed that this paralysis occurs due to two main reasons:

There is uncertainty regarding the quality of the product under consideration.

There are doubts about the fairness of the current price.

To address these challenges, WiseChoice harnesses the power of machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.

1.Evaluating Product Quality : To determine the quality of a product, reviews associated with the product are to be extensively analyzed. However, reviews present their own set of challenges:

        1) The sheer volume of reviews for each product can be overwhelming.

        2) The presence of fake reviews, which can be categorized into:

                i) Computer-generated reviews that mimic genuine feedback.

                ii) Paid reviews intended to artificially boost ratings

WiseChoice uses advanced algorithms to sift through the vast number of reviews, identifying genuine feedback while filtering out fake reviews. This helps provide a clearer and more accurate assessment of the product's quality.

It is acheived by :

        1. Eliminating Fake computer generated reviews
        2. Detecting Paid Reviews
        3. Evaluating Price Fairness
